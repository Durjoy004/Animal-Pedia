        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
            recognisable for its black stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily
            preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
            predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of
            its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving
            their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
